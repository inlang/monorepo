## 🌐 About inlang

**inlang is a whole ecosystem** of building blocks for your globalization (internationalization / i18n) efforts with the goal of helping companies to enter new markets in no time. For example:

- use [inlang paraglide-js](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs) to have a fully translated, typesafe & fast app in minutes
- use the [inlang CLI](https://inlang.com/m/2qj2w8pu/app-inlang-cli) to lint your messsages with lint rules or machine translate them & have quality control in CI/CD
- use the [inlang VSCode extension](https://inlang.com/m/r7kp499g/app-inlang-ideExtension) to translate your app right in the editor
- use the [inlang Web Edtior](https://inlang.com/m/tdozzpar/app-inlang-editor) to translate your app in the browser & invite collaborators to help you
- *build your own app / plugin / lint rule* with the [inlang SDK](https://inlang.com/documentation/architecture)
- ...

**Go to [inlang.com](https://inlang.com) to see all extensions to the inlang ecosystem.**

## :zap: Getting Started

It's fairly easy. You need two things to use inlang with any project:

1. A `project.inlang.json` file in the root of your project
2. A plugin that reads and writes the i18n messages of your project, we currently support [i18next](https://inlang.com/m/3i8bor92/plugin-inlang-i18next), [plain json](https://inlang.com/m/ig84ng0o/plugin-inlang-json) or [inlang message format](https://inlang.com/m/reootnfj/plugin-inlang-messageFormat).
3. 🏁 Done!
4. *Optional: Setup lint rules, machine translation, ...*

Example `project.inlang.json`
```json
{
	"$schema": "https://inlang.com/schema/project-settings",
	"sourceLanguageTag": "en",
	"languageTags": ["en", "de", "it"],
	"modules": [
		"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@inlang/plugin-json@4/dist/index.js"
	],
	"plugin.inlang.json": {
		"pathPattern": "./resources/{languageTag}.json"
	}
}
```
