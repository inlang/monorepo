# Intro

This is an experiemnt and test app to iterate on lix internals. This is NOT an example of how to propperly use lix api or how to build a good svelte app utilising lix. In the contraty, this app contains many aspects that are on purpose bad practice or lead to bad reactivity setup as test cases. If you are looking for a good start point for lix, we will add a lix/example folder as soon as the api is more stable.
