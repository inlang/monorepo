# @inlang/api

## Architecture

Requirements:

- The API _likely_ needs to be available externally in the future.
- Simple. The API does not handle databases or CRUD operations. Just integrating external services like Google Translate or OpenAI.
- No compilation step. Consuming the autogenerated API SDK on a client would become cumbersome otherwise.

Tools that have been evaluated:

[telefunc](https://telefunc.com/) - Requires transpilation, can't be consumed externally.
[tRPC](https://trpc.io/) - Too complex. Full fledged RPC framework for run full-stack apps.
[ts-rest](https://github.com/ts-rest/ts-rest) - Had type errors.
[zodios](https://github.com/ecyrbe/zodios) - More extensive than ts-rest but still simple.

ts-rest or zodios are the best suited. Zodios seems more mature see https://github.com/ecyrbe/zodios/discussions/342 and has been chosen.
