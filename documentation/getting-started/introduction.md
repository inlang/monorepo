## What is inlang?

inlang (pronounced /Ínlang/) is localization that consists of extendable tools and apps to make localization of software simple. It uses a versioned backend that allows for efficient collaboartion between developers, translators or designers.

### Git-compatible, infrastructure, and developer-first.

All tools and applications that inlang provides are built on Git, the version control, automation and collaboration system used by software engineers.

The automation and collaboration power a version control system provides might just be what could make localization _substantially_ easier, if not any kind of content based workflow. Read more about the rationale in [git as an SDK](/blog/git-as-sdk).

## Infrastructure Approach

Inlang is designed to enable developers to build on top of inlang to suit their needs.

Localization is too complicated and involves too many stakeholders to be solvable with one single solution. It needs a variety of solutions for developers, translators, product-managers, business owners, static site, dynamic apps, etc.

## Developer First

Localization (of software) starts and ends with developers. Yet, most existing solutions leave out the individiual developer experience when working on a localized codebase.

We are building tools that increases the developer experience in the context of localization because we experienced the struggles first-hand. Simple things like typesafety, CI/CD pipelines, and warnings during development are oftentimes missing. Long story short, dev tools are missing and required to make localization easier, so we are building them.
