# {% $frontmatter.shortTitle %} SDKs

inlang is not Framework specific. It can be used with any framework. To translate with the [editor](/editor) or use the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=inlang.vs-code-extension) only the `inlang.config.js` file is needed.

To get started with globalizing your app, you just need to choose an SDK from the options below and follow their setup guide. Once that's done, you can jump right into the [Quickstart](/documentation/quick-start). Plus, if you go with the SvelteKit SDK, you won't have to worry about any extra inlang setup!

## What benefits does the SDK provide?

- easy setup in a few simple step
- fully configurable depending on your projects needs
- fully integrated with your Framework (compiler-based to avoid a heavy runtime)
- automatic language specific routing (e.g. `/en/site`, `/de/site`)
- faster page loads (resource splitting per route) [coming soon]
- automatic setup for inlang editor and VS Code extension
