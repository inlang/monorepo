# {% $frontmatter.title %}

inlang is not Framework specific. It can be used with any framework. To translate with the [editor](/editor) or use the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=inlang.vs-code-extension) only the `inlang.config.js` file is needed.

However, we want to provide SDKs for some of the most popular frameworks. These SDKs are designed and fully integrated for the framework. They provide a lot of features that make it easy to use inlang with your framework.

## What benefits does the SDK provide?

- automatic language specific routing (e.g. `/en/site`,Â `/de/site`)
- faster page loads (resource splitting per route)
- fully integrated (compiler-based to avoid a heavy runtime)
- typesafety (due to compiler)
- better SEO (localized head tags and sitemaps)
- automatic setup for inlang editor and VS Code extension
