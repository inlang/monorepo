## Editor

Let non-technical team members (translators) manage messages in a repository. The editor is a baby of VSCode and Figma, combining a git based editor with a web-based and simple to use editor.

## Dev tools

Inlang is designed to be extended, the dev tools below are a small selection of dev tools that are maintained by inlang. With the [@inlang/core module](/documentation/build-on-inlang), you are able to build tools according your needs. Read more about the [infrastructure design principle](/documentation/why-inlang).

Improve developers' productivity by (semi)automating repetitive tasks like the extraction of messages, seeing localization related errors directly in the IDE and more.
