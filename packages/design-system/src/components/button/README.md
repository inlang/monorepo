The button comes in different variants. Those variants only differ
in styling.

Hence, the (index.ts)[./index.ts] file contains the common
logic and style of those buttons.

Individual style files such as (style.default.cts)[./style.default.cts] or
(style.outline.cts)[./style.outline.cts] define the button
variants `button-${color}` and `{button-outline-${color}` respectively.
